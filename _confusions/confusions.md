- Are we sure that meta OCL exists?
- If meta OCL exists, is it a good thing to learn by a neural network?
- What makes meta OCL a good thing to learn for a neural network?

- How do the authors find out whether meta OCL is exhibited by neural networks?
- Why do the authors say neural networks as a general term instead of a specific model they test? Is there anything to suggest that it is a general phenomena?

- Is there a faster way to demonstrate whether Meta OCL exists? 

- Can the way to demonstrate meta OCL be adapted to demonstrate existence of other phenomena?

- Can the detection process be made more accurate?

- Can this be made into an anytime algorithm?

- Can we make this into a streaming algorithm.

- What other data types will it work with? What about uncertain data?

- Why does this work?

- Can this detection method be made to work on a distributed system?

- How to apply this to a novel setting?

- What are the assumptions being made by the paper?

- What are the main parameters?

- How can it be made simpler?

- what is it good for?

Can I improve X by
Making it faster (by an order of magnitude)
Make it more accurate (statistically significant bump)
Make it an anytime algorithm
Making it a streaming algorithm
Making it work for a different data type (including uncertain data)
Making it work on low-powered devices
Explaining why it works so well
Making it work for distributed systems
Applying it in a novel setting
Removing a parameter or assumption
Making it disk aware (if its currently a main memory algorithm)
Making it simpler
Write the research statement in the following way:
X is good for Y (in the context of Z)
X can be extended to achieve Y (in the context of Z)
The adoption of X facilitates Y (for data in Z format)
An X approach to the Y problem mitigates the need for Z
Make sure the research statement is falsifiable
